### The app uses json file to show random popular book quotes, use GSON to parse the .json file. The app chooses one quote each time it is run.

### The app gets  quotes from an  API and return it back, and adds it to json file as well.


### I used nit test to check if the parsed json list gives right results.

### Classes in this app:


* App
